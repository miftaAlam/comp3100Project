# comp3100Project

1. Enter the SocketProgramming folder (My Java Project)
2. Enter the src folder inside SocketProgramming
3. src contains all the java files I have created, keeping track of my practical work starting from Week 3
4. STAGE 1 for the assignment is in the "DsClient.java" File, and it contains my LRR algorithm
5. The rest of the java files are NOT part of the assignment, just my practical work from Week 3 onwards 

## About the IP address
1. For the marker to run the tests on my DsClient on their own machine, the DsClient.java file needs to be in the same folder as the ds-server. So, as they are going to be on the same machine, I have changed the IP address to "localhost".
2. If you are trying to run the client on a different machine than the server, use the "ip a" command in terminal to get the IP address of the machine you are running the server on, and replace the "localhost" to that ipv4 address.
